82     	PROLOGUE
83     
84     
85     	Two households, both alike in dignity,
86     	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
87     	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
88     	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
89     	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
90     	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
91     	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
92     	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
93     	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
94     	And the continuance of their parents' rage,
95     	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
96     	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
97     	The which if you with patient ears attend,
98     	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

106    ACT I
107    
108    
109    
110    SCENE I	Verona. A public place.
111    
112    
113    	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
114    	armed with swords and bucklers]
115    
116    SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
117    
118    GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.
119    
120    SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
121    
122    GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
123    
124    SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.
125    
126    GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
127    
128    SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
129    
130    GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
131    	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
132    
133    SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
134    	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
135    
136    GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
137    	to the wall.
138    
139    SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
140    	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
141    	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
142    	to the wall.
143    
144    GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
145    
146    SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
147    	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
148    	maids, and cut off their heads.
149    
150    GREGORY	The heads of the maids?
151    
152    SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
153    	take it in what sense thou wilt.
154    
155    GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.
156    
157    SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
158    	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
159    
160    GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
161    	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
162    	two of the house of the Montagues.
163    
164    SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
165    
166    GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?
167    
168    SAMPSON	Fear me not.
169    
170    GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!
171    
172    SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
173    
174    GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
175    	they list.
176    
177    SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
178    	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
179    
180    	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]
181    
182    ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
183    
184    SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.
185    
186    ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
187    
188    SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
189    	ay?
190    
191    GREGORY	No.
192    
193    SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
194    	bite my thumb, sir.
195    
196    GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?
197    
198    ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.
199    
200    SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
201    
202    ABRAHAM	No better.
203    
204    SAMPSON	Well, sir.
205    
206    GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
207    
208    SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.
209    
210    ABRAHAM	You lie.
211    
212    SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
213    
214    	[They fight]
215    
216    	[Enter BENVOLIO]
217    
218    BENVOLIO	Part, fools!
219    	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
220    
221    	[Beats down their swords]
222    
223    	[Enter TYBALT]
224    
225    TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
226    	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
227    
228    BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
229    	Or manage it to part these men with me.
230    
231    TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
232    	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
233    	Have at thee, coward!
234    
235    	[They fight]
236    
237    	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
238    	then enter Citizens, with clubs]
239    
240    First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
241    	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
242    
243    	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]
244    
245    CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
246    
247    LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
248    
249    CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
250    	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
251    
252    	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
253    
254    MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
255    
256    LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
257    
258    	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]
259    
260    PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
261    	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
262    	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
263    	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
264    	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
265    	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
266    	Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
267    	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
268    	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
269    	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
270    	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
271    	And made Verona's ancient citizens
272    	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
273    	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
274    	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
275    	If ever you disturb our streets again,
276    	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
277    	For this time, all the rest depart away:
278    	You Capulet; shall go along with me:
279    	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
280    	To know our further pleasure in this case,
281    	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
282    	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
283    
284    	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]
285    
286    MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
287    	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
288    
289    BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,
290    	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
291    	I drew to part them: in the instant came
292    	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
293    	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
294    	He swung about his head and cut the winds,
295    	Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
296    	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
297    	Came more and more and fought on part and part,
298    	Till the prince came, who parted either part.
299    
300    LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
301    	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
302    
303    BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
304    	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
305    	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
306    	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
307    	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
308    	So early walking did I see your son:
309    	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
310    	And stole into the covert of the wood:
311    	I, measuring his affections by my own,
312    	That most are busied when they're most alone,
313    	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
314    	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
315    
316    MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
317    	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
318    	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
319    	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
320    	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
321    	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
322    	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
323    	And private in his chamber pens himself,
324    	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
325    	And makes himself an artificial night:
326    	Black and portentous must this humour prove,
327    	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
328    
329    BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
330    
331    MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.
332    
333    BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?
334    
335    MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:
336    	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
337    	Is to himself--I will not say how true--
338    	But to himself so secret and so close,
339    	So far from sounding and discovery,
340    	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
341    	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
342    	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
343    	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
344    	We would as willingly give cure as know.
345    
346    	[Enter ROMEO]
347    
348    BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
349    	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
350    
351    MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
352    	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
353    
354    	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
355    
356    BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.
357    
358    ROMEO	Is the day so young?
359    
360    BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.
361    
362    ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
363    	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
364    
365    BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
366    
367    ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
368    
369    BENVOLIO	In love?
370    
371    ROMEO	Out--
372    
373    BENVOLIO	Of love?
374    
375    ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.
376    
377    BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
378    	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
379    
380    ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
381    	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
382    	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
383    	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
384    	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
385    	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
386    	O any thing, of nothing first create!
387    	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
388    	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
389    	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
390    	sick health!
391    	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
392    	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
393    	Dost thou not laugh?
394    
395    BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.
396    
397    ROMEO	Good heart, at what?
398    
399    BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.
400    
401    ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.
402    	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
403    	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
404    	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
405    	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
406    	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
407    	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
408    	Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
409    	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
410    	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
411    	Farewell, my coz.
412    
413    BENVOLIO	                  Soft! I will go along;
414    	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
415    
416    ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
417    	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
418    
419    BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
420    
421    ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?
422    
423    BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.
424    	But sadly tell me who.
425    
426    ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
427    	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
428    	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
429    
430    BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
431    
432    ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
433    
434    BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
435    
436    ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
437    	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
438    	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
439    	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
440    	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
441    	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
442    	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
443    	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
444    	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
445    
446    BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
447    
448    ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
449    	For beauty starved with her severity
450    	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
451    	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
452    	To merit bliss by making me despair:
453    	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
454    	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
455    
456    BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
457    
458    ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.
459    
460    BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
461    	Examine other beauties.
462    
463    ROMEO	'Tis the way
464    	To call hers exquisite, in question more:
465    	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
466    	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
467    	He that is strucken blind cannot forget
468    	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
469    	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
470    	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note

493    CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,

495    	For men so old as we to keep the peace.
496    
497    PARIS	Of honourable reckoning are you both;
498    	And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
499    	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
500    
501    CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:
502    	My child is yet a stranger in the world;
503    	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
504    	Let two more summers wither in their pride,
505    	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
506    
507    PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.
508    
509    CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
510    	The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
511    	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
512    	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
513    	My will to her consent is but a part;
514    	An she agree, within her scope of choice
515    	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
516    	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
517    	Whereto I have invited many a guest,
518    	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
519    	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
520    	At my poor house look to behold this night
521    	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
522    	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
523    	When well-apparell'd April on the heel
524    	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
525    	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
526    	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
527    	And like her most whose merit most shall be:
528    	Which on more view, of many mine being one
529    	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
530    	Come, go with me.

543    	yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
544    	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
545    	sent to find those persons whose names are here

568    	Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
569

571    
572    ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

603

616    	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,

627    BENVOLIO	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,

666    JULIET	Madam, I am here.
667    	What is your will?
668    
669    LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
670    	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
671    	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
672    	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
673    
674    Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
675    
676    LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.
677    
678    Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
679    	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
680    	She is not fourteen. How long is it now
681    	To Lammas-tide?
682    
683    LADY CAPULET	                  A fortnight and odd days.
684    
685    Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
686    	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
687    	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
688    	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
689    	She was too good for me: but, as I said,
690    	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
691    	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
692    	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
693    	And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
694    	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
695    	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
696    	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
697    	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
698    	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
699    	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
700    	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
701    	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
702    	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
703    	To bid me trudge:
704    	And since that time it is eleven years;
705    	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
706    	She could have run and waddled all about;
707    	For even the day before, she broke her brow:
708    	And then my husband--God be with his soul!
709    	A' was a merry man--took up the child:
710    	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
711    	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
712    	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
713    	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
714    	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
715    	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
716    	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
717    	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
718    
719    LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
720    
721    Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
722    	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
723    	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
724    	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
725    	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
726    	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
727    	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
728    	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
729    
730    JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
731    
732    Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
733    	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
734    	An I might live to see thee married once,
735    	I have my wish.
736    
737    LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
738    	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
739    	How stands your disposition to be married?
740    
741    JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.
742    
743    Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
744    	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
745    
746    LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
747    	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
748    	Are made already mothers: by my count,
749    	I was your mother much upon these years
750    	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
751    	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
752    
753    Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man
754    	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
755    
756    LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
757    
758    Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
759    
760    LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
761    	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
762    	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
763    	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
764    	Examine every married lineament,
765    	And see how one another lends content
766    	And what obscured in this fair volume lies
767    	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
768    	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
769    	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
770    	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
771    	For fair without the fair within to hide:
772    	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
773    	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
774    	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
775    	By having him, making yourself no less.
776    
777    Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
778    
779    LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
780    
781    JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
782    	But no more deep will I endart mine eye
783    	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

834    
835    ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes

837    	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
838    
839    MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
840    	And soar with them above a common bound.
841    
842    ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
843    	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
844    	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:

849    
850    ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
851    	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
852    
853    MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
854    	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
855    	Give me a case to put my visage in:
856    	A visor for a visor! what care I
857    	What curious eye doth quote deformities?

870    	If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
871    	Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st

898    	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
899    	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
900    	Drawn with a team of little atomies
901    	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
902    	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
903    	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
904    	The traces of the smallest spider's web,
905    	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
906    	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
907    	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
908    	Not so big as a round little worm
909    	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
910    	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
911    	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
912    	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
913    	And in this state she gallops night by night
914    	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;

916    	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
917    	O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
918    	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
919    	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
920    	Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
921    	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
922    	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
923    	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
924    	Then dreams, he of another benefice:
925    	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
926    	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
927    	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
928    	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
929    	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
930    	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
931    	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
932    	That plats the manes of horses in the night,
933    	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
934    	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
935    	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
936    	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
937    	Making them women of good carriage:

950    	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

1013   	A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
1014   	Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:

1020   	More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,

1022   	Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
1023   	Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
1024   	For you and I are past our dancing days:
1025   	How long is't now since last yourself and I

1031   	'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
1032   	Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
1033   	Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

1045   Servant	I know not, sir.
1046   
1047   ROMEO	O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!

1050   	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
1051   	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
1052   	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
1053   	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
1054   	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
1055   	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!

1076   	He bears him like a portly gentleman;
1077   	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him

1090   	What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
1091   	Am I the master here, or you? go to.
1092   	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
1093   	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
1094   	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
1095   
1096   TYBALT	Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
1097   
1098   CAPULET	Go to, go to;
1099   	You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
1100   	This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
1101   	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
1102   	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
1103   	Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
1104   	I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
1105   
1106   TYBALT	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
1107   	Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
1108   	I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall

1113   ROMEO	[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand
1114   	This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
1115   	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
1116   	To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
1117   
1118   JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
1119   	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
1120   	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
1121   	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
1122   
1123   ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
1124   
1125   JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
1126   
1127   ROMEO	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
1128   	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
1129   
1130   JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
1131   
1132   ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
1133   	Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
1134   
1135   JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

1147   	Her mother is the lady of the house,
1148   	And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
1149   	I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;

1162   	Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
1163   	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.

1184   
1185   Nurse	His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1186   	The only son of your great enemy.
1187   
1188   JULIET	My only love sprung from my only hate!
1189   	Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1190   	Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1191   	That I must love a loathed enemy.

1220   	And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1221   	That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1222   	With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1223   	Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1224   	Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1225   	But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1226   	And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1227   	Being held a foe, he may not have access
1228   	To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1229   	And she as much in love, her means much less
1230   	To meet her new-beloved any where:
1231   	But passion lends them power, time means, to meet

1363   	Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1364   	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1365   	And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1366   
1367   JULIET	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1368   	Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1369   	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1370   	And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1371   
1372   ROMEO	[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1373   
1374   JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1375   	Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1376   	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1377   	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1378   	Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1379   	What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1380   	By any other name would smell as sweet;
1381   	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1382   	Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1383   	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1384   	And for that name which is no part of thee
1385   	Take all myself.
1386   
1387   ROMEO	                  I take thee at thy word:
1388   	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1389   	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1390   
1391   JULIET	What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1392   	So stumblest on my counsel?
1393   
1394   ROMEO	By a name
1395   	I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1396   	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1397   	Because it is an enemy to thee;
1398   	Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1399   
1400   JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1401   	Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1402   	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1403   
1404   ROMEO	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1405   
1406   JULIET	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1407   	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1408   	And the place death, considering who thou art,
1409   	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1410   
1411   ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1412   	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1413   	And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1414   	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1415   
1416   JULIET	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1417   
1418   ROMEO	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1419   	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1420   	And I am proof against their enmity.
1421   
1422   JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1423   
1424   ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1425   	And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1426   	My life were better ended by their hate,
1427   	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1428   
1429   JULIET	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1430   
1431   ROMEO	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1432   	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1433   	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1434   	As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1435   	I would adventure for such merchandise.
1436   
1437   JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1438   	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1439   	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1440   	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1441   	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1442   	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1443   	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1444   	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1445   	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1446   	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1447   	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1448   	I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1449   	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1450   	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1451   	And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1452   	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1453   	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1454   	I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1455   	But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1456   	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1457   	And not impute this yielding to light love,
1458   	Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1459   
1460   ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1461   	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1462   
1463   JULIET	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1464   	That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1465   	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1466   
1467   ROMEO	What shall I swear by?
1468   
1469   JULIET	Do not swear at all;
1470   	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1471   	Which is the god of my idolatry,
1472   	And I'll believe thee.
1473   
1474   ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--
1475   
1476   JULIET	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1477   	I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1478   	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1479   	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1480   	Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1481   	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1482   	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1483   	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1484   	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1485   
1486   ROMEO	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1487   
1488   JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1489   
1490   ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1491   
1492   JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1493   	And yet I would it were to give again.
1494   
1495   ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1496   
1497   JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1498   	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1499   	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1500   	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1501   	The more I have, for both are infinite.
1502   
1503   	[Nurse calls within]
1504   
1505   	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1506   	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1507   	Stay but a little, I will come again.
1508   
1509   	[Exit, above]
1510   
1511   ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1512   	Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1513   	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1514   
1515   	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
1516   
1517   JULIET	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1518   	If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1519   	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1520   	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1521   	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1522   	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1523   	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

1530   Nurse	[Within]  Madam!
1531   
1532   JULIET	By and by, I come:--
1533   	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1534   	To-morrow will I send.
1535   
1536   ROMEO	So thrive my soul--

1540   	[Exit, above]
1541

1543   	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from

1545   	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

1553   	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1554   	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1555   	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1556   	With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1557   
1558   ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1559   	How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1560   	Like softest music to attending ears!

1567   	Shall I send to thee?

1569   ROMEO	At the hour of nine.
1570   
1571   JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1572   	I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1573   
1574   ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1575   
1576   JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1577   	Remembering how I love thy company.
1578   
1579   ROMEO	And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1580   	Forgetting any other home but this.
1581   
1582   JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1583   	And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1584   	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1585   	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,

1617   
1618   
1619   	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket]
1620   
1621   FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1622   	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1623   	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1624   	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1625   	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1626   	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1627   	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1628   	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1629   	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1630   	What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1631   	And from her womb children of divers kind
1632   	We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1633   	Many for many virtues excellent,
1634   	None but for some and yet all different.
1635   	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1636   	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1637   	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1638   	But to the earth some special good doth give,
1639   	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1640   	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1641   	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1642   	And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1643   	Within the infant rind of this small flower
1644   	Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1645   	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1646   	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1647   	Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1648   	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1649   	And where the worser is predominant,
1650   	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1651   
1652   	[Enter ROMEO]
1653   
1654   ROMEO	Good morrow, father.
1655   
1656   FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!
1657   	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1658   	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1659   	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1660   	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1661   	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1662   	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1663   	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1664   	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1665   	Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1666   	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1667   	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1668   
1669   ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1670   
1671   FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1672   
1673   ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1674   	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1675   
1676   FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1677   
1678   ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1679   	I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1680   	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1681   	That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1682   	Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1683   	I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1684   	My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1685   
1686   FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1687   	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1688   
1689   ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1690   	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1691   	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1692   	And all combined, save what thou must combine
1693   	By holy marriage: when and where and how
1694   	We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1695   	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1696   	That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1697   
1698   FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1699   	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1700   	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1701   	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1702   	Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1703   	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1704   	How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1705   	To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1706   	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1707   	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1708   	Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1709   	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1710   	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1711   	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1712   	And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1713   	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1714   
1715   ROMEO	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1716   
1717   FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1718   
1719   ROMEO	And bad'st me bury love.
1720   
1721   FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,
1722   	To lay one in, another out to have.
1723   
1724   ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1725   	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1726   	The other did not so.
1727   
1728   FRIAR LAURENCE	O, she knew well
1729   	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1730   	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1731   	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1732   	For this alliance may so happy prove,
1733   	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1734   
1735   ROMEO	O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

1803   	that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1804   	bones, their bones!
1805   
1806   	[Enter ROMEO]
1807   
1808   BENVOLIO	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1809   
1810   MERCUTIO	Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1811   	how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1812   	that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1813   	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1814   	be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1815   	Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1816   	eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1817   	Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1818   	to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1819   	fairly last night.
1820   
1821   ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1822   
1823   MERCUTIO	The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1824   
1825   ROMEO	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1826   	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1827   
1828   MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1829   	constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1830   
1831   ROMEO	Meaning, to court'sy.
1832   
1833   MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1834   
1835   ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.
1836   
1837   MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1838   
1839   ROMEO	Pink for flower.
1840   
1841   MERCUTIO	Right.
1842   
1843   ROMEO	Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1844   
1845   MERCUTIO	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1846   	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1847   	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1848   
1849   ROMEO	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1850   	singleness.
1851   
1852   MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1853   
1854   ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1855   
1856   MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1857   	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1858   	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1859   	was I with you there for the goose?
1860   
1861   ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1862   	not there for the goose.
1863   
1864   MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1865   
1866   ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.
1867   
1868   MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1869   	sharp sauce.
1870   
1871   ROMEO	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1872   
1873   MERCUTIO	O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1874   	inch narrow to an ell broad!
1875   
1876   ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1877   	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1878   
1879   MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1880   	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1881   	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1882   	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1883   	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1884   
1885   BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.
1886   
1887   MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1888   
1889   BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1890   
1891   MERCUTIO	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1892   	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1893   	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1894   
1895   ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!
1896   
1897   	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
1898   
1899   MERCUTIO	A sail, a sail!
1900   
1901   BENVOLIO	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1902   
1903   Nurse	Peter!
1904   
1905   PETER	Anon!
1906   
1907   Nurse	My fan, Peter.
1908   
1909   MERCUTIO	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1910   	fairer face.
1911   
1912   Nurse	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1913   
1914   MERCUTIO	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1915   
1916   Nurse	Is it good den?
1917   
1918   MERCUTIO	'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1919   	dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1920   
1921   Nurse	Out upon you! what a man are you!
1922   
1923   ROMEO	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1924   	mar.
1925   
1926   Nurse	By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1927   	quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1928   	may find the young Romeo?
1929   
1930   ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1931   	you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1932   	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1933   
1934   Nurse	You say well.
1935   
1936   MERCUTIO	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1937   	wisely, wisely.
1938   
1939   Nurse	if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1940   	you.
1941   
1942   BENVOLIO	She will indite him to some supper.
1943   
1944   MERCUTIO	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1945   
1946   ROMEO	What hast thou found?
1947   
1948   MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1949   	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1950   
1951   	[Sings]
1952   
1953   	An old hare hoar,
1954   	And an old hare hoar,
1955   	Is very good meat in lent
1956   	But a hare that is hoar
1957   	Is too much for a score,
1958   	When it hoars ere it be spent.
1959   	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1960   	to dinner, thither.
1961   
1962   ROMEO	I will follow you.
1963   
1964   MERCUTIO	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1965

1967   
1968   	'lady, lady, lady.'
1969

1971   
1972   Nurse	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1973   	merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1974   
1975   ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1976   	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1977   	to in a month.
1978   
1979   Nurse	An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1980   	down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1981   	Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1982   	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1983   	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1984   	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1985   
1986   PETER	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1987   	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1988   	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1989   	good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1990   
1991   Nurse	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1992   	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1993   	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1994   	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1995   	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1996   	a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1997   	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1998   	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1999   	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
2000   	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
2001   
2002   ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
2003   	protest unto thee--
2004   
2005   Nurse	Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
2006   	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
2007   
2008   ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
2009   
2010   Nurse	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
2011   	I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2012   
2013   ROMEO	Bid her devise
2014   	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
2015   	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
2016   	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
2017   
2018   Nurse	No truly sir; not a penny.
2019   
2020   ROMEO	Go to; I say you shall.
2021   
2022   Nurse	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
2023   
2024   ROMEO	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
2025   	Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2026   	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
2027   	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
2028   	Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2029   	Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
2030   	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
2031   
2032   Nurse	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
2033   
2034   ROMEO	What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
2035   
2036   Nurse	Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
2037   	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
2038   
2039   ROMEO	I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
2040   
2041   NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
2042   	Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
2043   	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
2044   	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
2045   	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
2046   	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
2047   	man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
2048   	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
2049   	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
2050   
2051   ROMEO	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
2052   
2053   Nurse	Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
2054   	the--No; I know it begins with some other
2055   	letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
2056   	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
2057   	to hear it.
2058   
2059   ROMEO	Commend me to thy lady.
2060   
2061   Nurse	Ay, a thousand times.

2086   
2087   JULIET	The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2088   	In half an hour she promised to return.
2089   	Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
2090   	O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
2091   	Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
2092   	Driving back shadows over louring hills:
2093   	Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
2094   	And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2095   	Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2096   	Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2097   	Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
2098   	Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2099   	She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2100   	My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2101   	And his to me:
2102   	But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
2103   	Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
2104   	O God, she comes!
2105   
2106   	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
2107   
2108   	O honey nurse, what news?
2109   	Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

2115   JULIET	Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
2116   	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
2117   	If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2118   	By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2119   
2120   Nurse	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
2121   	Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
2122   
2123   JULIET	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
2124   	Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
2125   
2126   Nurse	Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
2127   	Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2128   
2129   JULIET	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
2130   	To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2131   	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2132   	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2133   	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
2134   	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
2135   	Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
2136   
2137   Nurse	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
2138   	how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
2139   	face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
2140   	all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
2141   	though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
2142   	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
2143   	but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
2144   	ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
2145   
2146   JULIET	No, no: but all this did I know before.
2147   	What says he of our marriage? what of that?
2148   
2149   Nurse	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
2150   	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2151   	My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
2152   	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
2153   	To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
2154   
2155   JULIET	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2156   	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
2157   
2158   Nurse	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
2159   	courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
2160   	warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
2161   
2162   JULIET	Where is my mother! why, she is within;
2163   	Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
2164   	'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2165   	Where is your mother?'
2166   
2167   Nurse	O God's lady dear!
2168   	Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
2169   	Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2170   	Henceforward do your messages yourself.

2179   	There stays a husband to make you a wife:
2180   	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
2181   	They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2182   	Hie you to church; I must another way,
2183   	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
2184   	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
2185   	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
2186   	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.

2208   FRIAR LAURENCE	So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
2209   	That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
2210   
2211   ROMEO	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
2212   	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2213   	That one short minute gives me in her sight:
2214   	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2215   	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
2216   	It is enough I may but call her mine.

2218   FRIAR LAURENCE	These violent delights have violent ends
2219   	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2220   	Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
2221   	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2222   	And in the taste confounds the appetite:
2223   	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
2224   	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

2226   	[Enter JULIET]
2227   
2228   	Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot

2240   ROMEO	Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2241   	Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
2242   	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2243   	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2244   	Unfold the imagined happiness that both
2245   	Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2246   
2247   JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2248   	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
2249   	They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2250   	But my true love is grown to such excess
2251   	I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2252   
2253   FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2254   	For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2255   	Till holy church incorporate two in one.

2268   
2269   SCENE I	A public place.
2270   
2271   
2272   	[Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants]
2273   
2274   BENVOLIO	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2275   	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
2276   	And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
2277   	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2278   
2279   MERCUTIO	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
2280   	enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
2281   	upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
2282   	thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
2283   	it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2284   
2285   BENVOLIO	Am I like such a fellow?
2286   
2287   MERCUTIO	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
2288   	any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
2289   	soon moody to be moved.
2290   
2291   BENVOLIO	And what to?
2292   
2293   MERCUTIO	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
2294   	shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
2295   	thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
2296   	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
2297   	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2298   	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
2299   	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
2300   	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
2301   	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
2302   	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
2303   	man for coughing in the street, because he hath
2304   	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
2305   	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
2306   	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
2307   	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
2308   	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
2309   
2310   BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
2311   	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2312   
2313   MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!
2314   
2315   BENVOLIO	By my head, here come the Capulets.
2316   
2317   MERCUTIO	By my heel, I care not.
2318   
2319   	[Enter TYBALT and others]
2320   
2321   TYBALT	Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2322   	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2323   
2324   MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2325   	something; make it a word and a blow.
2326   
2327   TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2328   	will give me occasion.
2329   
2330   MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2331   
2332   TYBALT	Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2333   
2334   MERCUTIO	Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2335   	thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2336   	discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2337   	make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2338   
2339   BENVOLIO	We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2340   	Either withdraw unto some private place,
2341   	And reason coldly of your grievances,
2342   	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2343   
2344   MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2345   	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2346   
2347   	[Enter ROMEO]
2348   
2349   TYBALT	Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2350   
2351   MERCUTIO	But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2352   	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2353   	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2354   
2355   TYBALT	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2356   	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2357   
2358   ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2359   	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2360   	To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2361   	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2362   
2363   TYBALT	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2364   	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2365   
2366   ROMEO	I do protest, I never injured thee,
2367   	But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2368   	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2369   	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2370   	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2371   
2372   MERCUTIO	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2373   	Alla stoccata carries it away.
2374   
2375   	[Draws]
2376   
2377   	Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2378   
2379   TYBALT	What wouldst thou have with me?
2380   
2381   MERCUTIO	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2382   	lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2383   	shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2384   	eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2385   	by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2386   	ears ere it be out.
2387   
2388   TYBALT	I am for you.
2389   
2390   	[Drawing]
2391   
2392   ROMEO	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2393   
2394   MERCUTIO	Come, sir, your passado.
2395   
2396   	[They fight]
2397   
2398   ROMEO	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2399   	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2400   	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2401   	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2402   	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2403   
2404   	[TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies
2405   	with his followers]
2406   
2407   MERCUTIO	I am hurt.
2408   	A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2409   	Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2410   
2411   BENVOLIO	What, art thou hurt?
2412   
2413   MERCUTIO	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2414   	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2415   
2416   	[Exit Page]
2417   
2418   ROMEO	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2419   
2420   MERCUTIO	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2421   	church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2422   	me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2423   	am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2424   	both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2425   	cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2426   	rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2427   	arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2428   	was hurt under your arm.
2429   
2430   ROMEO	I thought all for the best.
2431   
2432   MERCUTIO	Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2433   	Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2434   	They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2435   	And soundly too: your houses!
2436   
2437   	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]
2438   
2439   ROMEO	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2440   	My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2441   	In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2442   	With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2443   	Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2444   	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2445   	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2446   
2447   	[Re-enter BENVOLIO]
2448   
2449   BENVOLIO	O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2450   	That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2451   	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2452   
2453   ROMEO	This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2454   	This but begins the woe, others must end.
2455   
2456   BENVOLIO	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2457   
2458   ROMEO	Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2459   	Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2460   	And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2461   
2462   	[Re-enter TYBALT]
2463   
2464   	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2465   	That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2466   	Is but a little way above our heads,
2467   	Staying for thine to keep him company:
2468   	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2469   
2470   TYBALT	Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2471   	Shalt with him hence.
2472   
2473   ROMEO	This shall determine that.
2474   
2475   	[They fight; TYBALT falls]
2476   
2477   BENVOLIO	Romeo, away, be gone!
2478   	The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2479   	Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2480   	If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2481   
2482   ROMEO	O, I am fortune's fool!
2483   
2484   BENVOLIO	Why dost thou stay?

2488   	[Enter Citizens, &c]
2489   
2490   First Citizen	Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2491   	Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2492   
2493   BENVOLIO	There lies that Tybalt.
2494   
2495   First Citizen	Up, sir, go with me;
2496   	I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2497   
2498   	[Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their
2499   	Wives, and others]
2500   
2501   PRINCE	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2502   
2503   BENVOLIO	O noble prince, I can discover all
2504   	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2505   	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2506   	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2507   
2508   LADY CAPULET	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2509   	O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2510   	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2511   	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2512   	O cousin, cousin!
2513   
2514   PRINCE	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2515   
2516   BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2517   	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2518   	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2519   	Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2520   	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2521   	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2522   	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2523   	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2524   	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2525   	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2526   	Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2527   	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2528   	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2529   	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2530   	his tongue,
2531   	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2532   	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2533   	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2534   	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2535   	But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2536   	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2537   	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2538   	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2539   	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2540   	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2541   
2542   LADY CAPULET	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2543   	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2544   	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2545   	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2546   	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2547   	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2548   
2549   PRINCE	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2550   	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2551   
2552   MONTAGUE	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2553   	His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2554   	The life of Tybalt.
2555   
2556   PRINCE	And for that offence
2557   	Immediately we do exile him hence:
2558   	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2559   	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2560   	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2561   	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2562   	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2563   	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2564   	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2565   	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2566   	Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2567   	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

2582   
2583   
2584   	[Enter JULIET]
2585   
2586   JULIET	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2587   	Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2588   	As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2589   	And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2590   	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2591   	That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2592   	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2593   	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2594   	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2595   	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2596   	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2597   	And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2598   	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2599   	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2600   	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2601   	Think true love acted simple modesty.
2602   	Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2603   	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2604   	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2605   	Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2606   	Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2607   	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2608   	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2609   	That all the world will be in love with night
2610   	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2611   	O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2612   	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2613   	Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2614   	As is the night before some festival
2615   	To an impatient child that hath new robes
2616   	And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2617   	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2618   	But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2619   
2620   	[Enter Nurse, with cords]
2621   
2622   	Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords

2632   	We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2633   	Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2634   
2635   JULIET	Can heaven be so envious?
2636   
2637   Nurse	Romeo can,
2638   	Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2639   	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2640   
2641   JULIET	What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2642   	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2643   	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2644   	And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2645   	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2646   	I am not I, if there be such an I;
2647   	Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2648   	If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2649   	Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2650   
2651   Nurse	I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2652   	God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2653   	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2654   	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2655   	All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2656   
2657   JULIET	O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2658   	To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2659   	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2660   	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2661   
2662   Nurse	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2663   	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2664   	That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2665   
2666   JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2667   	Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2668   	My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2669   	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2670   	For who is living, if those two are gone?
2671   
2672   Nurse	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2673   	Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2674   
2675   JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2676   
2677   Nurse	It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2678   
2679   JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2680   	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2681   	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2682   	Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2683   	Despised substance of divinest show!
2684   	Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2685   	A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2686   	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2687   	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2688   	In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2689   	Was ever book containing such vile matter
2690   	So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2691   	In such a gorgeous palace!
2692   
2693   Nurse	There's no trust,
2694   	No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2695   	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2696   	Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2697   	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2698   	Shame come to Romeo!
2699   
2700   JULIET	Blister'd be thy tongue
2701   	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2702   	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2703   	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2704   	Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2705   	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2706   
2707   Nurse	Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2708   
2709   JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2710   	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2711   	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2712   	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2713   	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2714   	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2715   	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2716   	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2717   	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2718   	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2719   	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2720   	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2721   	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2722   	But, O, it presses to my memory,
2723   	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2724   	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2725   	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2726   	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2727   	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2728   	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2729   	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2730   	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2731   	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2732   	Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2733   	But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2734   	'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2735   	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2736   	All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2737   	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2738   	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2739   	Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2740   
2741   Nurse	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2742   	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2743   
2744   JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2745   	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2746   	Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2747   	Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2748   	He made you for a highway to my bed;
2749   	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2750   	Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2751   	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2752   
2753   Nurse	Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2754   	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2755   	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2756   	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2757   
2758   JULIET	O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2759   	And bid him come to take his last farewell.

2774   
2775   
2776   	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]
2777   
2778   FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2779   	Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2780   	And thou art wedded to calamity.
2781   
2782   	[Enter ROMEO]
2783   
2784   ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2785   	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2786   	That I yet know not?
2787   
2788   FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar
2789   	Is my dear son with such sour company:
2790   	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2791   
2792   ROMEO	What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2793   
2794   FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2795   	Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2796   
2797   ROMEO	Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2798   	For exile hath more terror in his look,
2799   	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2800   
2801   FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2802   	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2803   
2804   ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,
2805   	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2806   	Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2807   	And world's exile is death: then banished,
2808   	Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2809   	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2810   	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2811   
2812   FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2813   	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2814   	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2815   	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2816   	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2817   
2818   ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2819   	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2820   	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2821   	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2822   	But Romeo may not: more validity,
2823   	More honourable state, more courtship lives
2824   	In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2825   	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2826   	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2827   	Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2828   	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2829   	But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2830   	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2831   	They are free men, but I am banished.
2832   	And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2833   	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2834   	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2835   	But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2836   	O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2837   	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2838   	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2839   	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2840   	To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2841   
2842   FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2843   
2844   ROMEO	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2845   
2846   FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2847   	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2848   	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2849   
2850   ROMEO	Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2851   	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2852   	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2853   	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2854   
2855   FRIAR LAURENCE	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2856   
2857   ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2858   
2859   FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2860   
2861   ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2862   	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2863   	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2864   	Doting like me and like me banished,
2865   	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2866   	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2867   	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2868   
2869   	[Knocking within]
2870   
2871   FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2872

2874   	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2875   
2876   	[Knocking]
2877   
2878   FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2879   	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2880   
2881   	[Knocking]
2882   
2883   	Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2884   	What simpleness is this! I come, I come!

2888   	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2889   
2890   Nurse	[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know
2891   	my errand;
2892   	I come from Lady Juliet.
2893   
2894   FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.
2895   
2896   	[Enter Nurse]
2897   
2898   Nurse	O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2899   	Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2900   
2901   FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2902   
2903   Nurse	O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2904   	Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2905   	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2906   	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2907   	Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2908   	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2909   	Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2910   
2911   ROMEO	Nurse!
2912   
2913   Nurse	Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2914   
2915   ROMEO	Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2916   	Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2917   	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2918   	With blood removed but little from her own?
2919   	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2920   	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2921   
2922   Nurse	O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2923   	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2924   	And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2925   	And then down falls again.
2926   
2927   ROMEO	As if that name,
2928   	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2929   	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2930   	Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2931   	In what vile part of this anatomy
2932   	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2933   	The hateful mansion.
2934   
2935   	[Drawing his sword]
2936   
2937   FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:
2938   	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2939   	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2940   	The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2941   	Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2942   	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2943   	Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2944   	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2945   	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2946   	And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2947   	By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2948   	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2949   	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2950   	In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2951   	Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2952   	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2953   	And usest none in that true use indeed
2954   	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2955   	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2956   	Digressing from the valour of a man;
2957   	Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2958   	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2959   	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2960   	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2961   	Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2962   	Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2963   	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2964   	What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2965   	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2966   	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2967   	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2968   	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2969   	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2970   	A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2971   	Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2972   	But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2973   	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2974   	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2975   	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2976   	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2977   	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2978   	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2979   	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2980   	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2981   	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2982   	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2983   	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2984   	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2985   	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2986   	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2987   	Romeo is coming.
2988   
2989   Nurse	O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2990   	To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2991   	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2992   
2993   ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2994   
2995   Nurse	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2996   	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

3001

3003   	Either be gone before the watch be set,
3004   	Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
3005   	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
3006   	And he shall signify from time to time
3007   	Every good hap to you that chances here:
3008   	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
3009

3034   	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:

3058   	We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
3059   	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
3060   	It may be thought we held him carelessly,
3061   	Being our kinsman, if we revel much:

3117   	I have more care to stay than will to go:
3118   	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
3119   	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
3120   
3121   JULIET	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
3122   	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
3123   	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
3124   	Some say the lark makes sweet division;
3125   	This doth not so, for she divideth us:
3126   	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
3127   	O, now I would they had changed voices too!
3128   	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
3129   	Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
3130   	O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
3131   
3132   ROMEO	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
3133   
3134   	[Enter Nurse, to the chamber]
3135   
3136   Nurse	Madam!
3137   
3138   JULIET	Nurse?
3139   
3140   Nurse	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
3141   	The day is broke; be wary, look about.
3142   
3143   	[Exit]
3144   
3145   JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
3146   
3147   ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
3148   
3149   	[He goeth down]
3150   
3151   JULIET	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
3152   	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
3153   	For in a minute there are many days:
3154   	O, by this count I shall be much in years
3155   	Ere I again behold my Romeo!
3156   
3157   ROMEO	Farewell!
3158   	I will omit no opportunity
3159   	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
3160   
3161   JULIET	O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
3162   
3163   ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
3164   	For sweet discourses in our time to come.
3165   
3166   JULIET	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
3167   	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
3168   	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
3169   	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
3170   
3171   ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
3172   	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
3173   
3174   	[Exit]
3175   
3176   JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
3177   	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
3178   	That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
3179   	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
3180   	But send him back.
3181   
3182   LADY CAPULET	[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?
3183   
3184   JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
3185   	Is she not down so late, or up so early?
3186   	What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
3187   
3188   	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
3189   
3190   LADY CAPULET	Why, how now, Juliet!
3191   
3192   JULIET	Madam, I am not well.
3193   
3194   LADY CAPULET	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
3195   	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
3196   	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
3197   	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
3198   	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
3199   
3200   JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
3201   
3202   LADY CAPULET	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
3203   	Which you weep for.
3204   
3205   JULIET	Feeling so the loss,
3206   	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
3207   
3208   LADY CAPULET	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
3209   	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
3210   
3211   JULIET	What villain madam?
3212   
3213   LADY CAPULET	That same villain, Romeo.
3214   
3215   JULIET	[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
3216   	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
3217   	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
3218   
3219   LADY CAPULET	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
3220   
3221   JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
3222   	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
3223   
3224   LADY CAPULET	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
3225   	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
3226   	Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
3227   	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
3228   	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
3229   	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
3230   
3231   JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
3232   	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
3233   	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
3234   	Madam, if you could find out but a man
3235   	To bear a poison, I would temper it;
3236   	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
3237   	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
3238   	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
3239   	To wreak the love I bore my cousin
3240   	Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
3241   
3242   LADY CAPULET	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
3243   	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
3244   
3245   JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:
3246   	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
3247   
3248   LADY CAPULET	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
3249   	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
3250   	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
3251   	That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
3252   
3253   JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
3254   
3255   LADY CAPULET	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
3256   	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
3257   	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
3258   	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
3259   
3260   JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
3261   	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
3262   	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
3263   	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
3264   	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
3265   	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
3266   	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
3267   	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
3268   
3269   LADY CAPULET	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
3270   	And see how he will take it at your hands.
3271   
3272   	[Enter CAPULET and Nurse]
3273   
3274   CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
3275   	But for the sunset of my brother's son
3276   	It rains downright.
3277   	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
3278   	Evermore showering? In one little body
3279   	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
3280   	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
3281   	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
3282   	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
3283   	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
3284   	Without a sudden calm, will overset
3285   	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
3286   	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
3287   
3288   LADY CAPULET	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
3289   	I would the fool were married to her grave!
3290   
3291   CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
3292   	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
3293   	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
3294   	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
3295   	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
3296   
3297   JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
3298   	Proud can I never be of what I hate;
3299   	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
3300   
3301   CAPULET	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
3302   	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
3303   	And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
3304   	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
3305   	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
3306   	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
3307   	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
3308   	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
3309   	You tallow-face!
3310   
3311   LADY CAPULET	                  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
3312   
3313   JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
3314   	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
3315   
3316   CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
3317   	I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
3318   	Or never after look me in the face:
3319   	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
3320   	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
3321   	That God had lent us but this only child;
3322   	But now I see this one is one too much,
3323   	And that we have a curse in having her:
3324   	Out on her, hilding!
3325   
3326   Nurse	God in heaven bless her!
3327   	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
3328   
3329   CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
3330   	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
3331   
3332   Nurse	I speak no treason.
3333   
3334   CAPULET	O, God ye god-den.
3335   
3336   Nurse	May not one speak?
3337   
3338   CAPULET	                  Peace, you mumbling fool!
3339   	Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
3340   	For here we need it not.
3341   
3342   LADY CAPULET	You are too hot.
3343   
3344   CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad:
3345   	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
3346   	Alone, in company, still my care hath been
3347   	To have her match'd: and having now provided
3348   	A gentleman of noble parentage,
3349   	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
3350   	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
3351   	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
3352   	And then to have a wretched puling fool,
3353   	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
3354   	To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
3355   	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
3356   	But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
3357   	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
3358   	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
3359   	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
3360   	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
3361   	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
3362   	the streets,
3363   	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
3364   	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
3365   	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
3366   
3367   	[Exit]
3368   
3369   JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
3370   	That sees into the bottom of my grief?
3371   	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
3372   	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
3373   	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
3374   	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
3375   
3376   LADY CAPULET	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
3377   	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
3378   
3379   	[Exit]
3380   
3381   JULIET	O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
3382   	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
3383   	How shall that faith return again to earth,
3384   	Unless that husband send it me from heaven
3385   	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
3386   	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
3387   	Upon so soft a subject as myself!
3388   	What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
3389   	Some comfort, nurse.
3390   
3391   Nurse	Faith, here it is.
3392   	Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
3393   	That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
3394   	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
3395   	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
3396   	I think it best you married with the county.
3397   	O, he's a lovely gentleman!
3398   	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
3399   	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
3400   	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
3401   	I think you are happy in this second match,
3402   	For it excels your first: or if it did not,
3403   	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
3404   	As living here and you no use of him.
3405   
3406   JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?
3407   
3408   Nurse	And from my soul too;
3409   	Or else beshrew them both.
3410   
3411   JULIET	Amen!
3412   
3413   Nurse	What?
3414   
3415   JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3416   	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3417   	Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3418   	To make confession and to be absolved.
3419   
3420   Nurse	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3421   
3422   	[Exit]
3423   
3424   JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3425   	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3426   	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3427   	Which she hath praised him with above compare
3428   	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3429   	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3430   	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3431   	If all else fail, myself have power to die.

3441   ACT IV
3442   
3443   
3444   
3445   SCENE I	Friar Laurence's cell.
3446   
3447   
3448   	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS]
3449   
3450   FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3451   
3452   PARIS	My father Capulet will have it so;
3453   	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3454   
3455   FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3456   	Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3457   
3458   PARIS	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3459   	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3460   	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3461   	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3462   	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3463   	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3464   	To stop the inundation of her tears;
3465   	Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3466   	May be put from her by society:
3467   	Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3468   
3469   FRIAR LAURENCE	[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3470   	Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3471   
3472   	[Enter JULIET]
3473   
3474   PARIS	Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3475   
3476   JULIET	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3477   
3478   PARIS	That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3479   
3480   JULIET	What must be shall be.
3481   
3482   FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.
3483   
3484   PARIS	Come you to make confession to this father?
3485   
3486   JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.
3487   
3488   PARIS	Do not deny to him that you love me.
3489   
3490   JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.
3491   
3492   PARIS	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3493   
3494   JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,
3495   	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3496   
3497   PARIS	Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3498   
3499   JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;
3500   	For it was bad enough before their spite.
3501   
3502   PARIS	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3503   
3504   JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3505   	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3506   
3507   PARIS	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3508   
3509   JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3510   	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3511   	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3512   
3513   FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3514   	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3515   
3516   PARIS	God shield I should disturb devotion!
3517   	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3518   	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3519   
3520   	[Exit]
3521   
3522   JULIET	O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3523   	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3524   
3525   FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3526   	It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3527   	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3528   	On Thursday next be married to this county.
3529   
3530   JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3531   	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3532   	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3533   	Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3534   	And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3535   	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3536   	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3537   	Shall be the label to another deed,
3538   	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3539   	Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3540   	Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3541   	Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3542   	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3543   	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3544   	Which the commission of thy years and art
3545   	Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3546   	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3547   	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3548   
3549   FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3550   	Which craves as desperate an execution.
3551   	As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3552   	If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3553   	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3554   	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3555   	A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3556   	That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3557   	And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3558   
3559   JULIET	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3560   	From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3561   	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3562   	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3563   	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3564   	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3565   	With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3566   	Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3567   	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3568   	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3569   	And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3570   	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3571   
3572   FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3573   	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3574   	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3575   	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3576   	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3577   	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3578   	When presently through all thy veins shall run
3579   	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3580   	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3581   	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3582   	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3583   	To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3584   	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3585   	Each part, deprived of supple government,
3586   	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3587   	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3588   	Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3589   	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3590   	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3591   	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3592   	Then, as the manner of our country is,
3593   	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3594   	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3595   	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3596   	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3597   	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3598   	And hither shall he come: and he and I
3599   	Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3600   	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3601   	And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3602   	If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3603   	Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3604   
3605   JULIET	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3606   
3607   FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3608   	In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3609   	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3610   
3611   JULIET	Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.

3679   CAPULET	Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:

3757   
3758   	[Laying down her dagger]
3759   
3760   	What if it be a poison, which the friar
3761   	Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3762   	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3763   	Because he married me before to Romeo?
3764   	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3765   	For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3766   	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,

3770   	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3771   	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3772   	Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3773   	The horrible conceit of death and night,
3774   	Together with the terror of the place,--
3775   	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3776   	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3777   	Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3778   	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,

3780   	At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3781   	Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3782   	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3783   	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3784   	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--

3998   	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3999   	She's not well married that lives married long;
4000   	But she's best married that dies married young.
4001   	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
4002   	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
4003   	In all her best array bear her to church:
4004   	For though fond nature bids us an lament,
4005   	Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
4006   
4007   CAPULET	All things that we ordained festival,
4008   	Turn from their office to black funeral;
4009   	Our instruments to melancholy bells,
4010   	Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
4011   	Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
4012   	Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
4013   	And all things change them to the contrary.
4014   
4015   FRIAR LAURENCE	Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
4016   	And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare

4018   	The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;

4036   
4037   First Musician	Why 'Heart's ease?'
4038   
4039   PETER	O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
4040   	heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
4041   	to comfort me.
4042   
4043   First Musician	Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
4044   
4045   PETER	You will not, then?
4046   
4047   First Musician	No.

4053   PETER	No money, on my faith, but the gleek;

4076

4078

4083   Third Musician	Faith, I know not what to say.
4084   
4085   PETER	O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
4086   	for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'

4114   
4115   ROMEO	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
4116   	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
4117   	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
4118   	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
4119   	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
4120   	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
4121   	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
4122   	to think!--
4123   	And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
4124   	That I revived, and was an emperor.
4125   	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
4126   	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

4130   	News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
4131   	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
4132   	How doth my lady? Is my father well?
4133   	How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
4134   	For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
4135   
4136   BALTHASAR	Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
4137   	Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
4138   	And her immortal part with angels lives.
4139   	I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
4140   	And presently took post to tell it you:
4141   	O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
4142   	Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
4143   
4144   ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
4145   	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
4146   	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
4147   
4148   BALTHASAR	I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
4149   	Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
4150   	Some misadventure.
4151   
4152   ROMEO	                  Tush, thou art deceived:
4153   	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
4154   	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
4155   
4156   BALTHASAR	No, my good lord.
4157   
4158   ROMEO	                  No matter: get thee gone,
4159   	And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
4160   
4161   	[Exit BALTHASAR]
4162   
4163   	Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
4164   	Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
4165   	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
4166   	I do remember an apothecary,--
4167   	And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
4168   	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
4169   	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
4170   	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
4171   	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
4172   	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
4173   	Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
4174   	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
4175   	Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
4176   	Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
4177   	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
4178   	Noting this penury, to myself I said
4179   	'An if a man did need a poison now,
4180   	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
4181   	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
4182   	O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
4183   	And this same needy man must sell it me.
4184   	As I remember, this should be the house.
4185   	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
4186   	What, ho! apothecary!
4187   
4188   	[Enter Apothecary]
4189   
4190   Apothecary	Who calls so loud?
4191   
4192   ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
4193   	Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
4194   	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
4195   	As will disperse itself through all the veins
4196   	That the life-weary taker may fall dead
4197   	And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
4198   	As violently as hasty powder fired
4199   	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
4200   
4201   Apothecary	Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
4202   	Is death to any he that utters them.
4203   
4204   ROMEO	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
4205   	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
4206   	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
4207   	Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
4208   	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
4209   	The world affords no law to make thee rich;
4210   	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
4211   
4212   Apothecary	My poverty, but not my will, consents.
4213   
4214   ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
4215   
4216   Apothecary	Put this in any liquid thing you will,
4217   	And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
4218   	Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
4219   
4220   ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
4221   	Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
4222   	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
4223   	I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
4224   	Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
4225   	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
4226   	To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

4257   	Suspecting that we both were in a house
4258   	Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
4259   	Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
4260   	So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
4261   
4262   FRIAR LAURENCE	Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

4264   FRIAR JOHN	I could not send it,--here it is again,--

4344   	Why I descend into this bed of death,

4448   	Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
4449   	Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
4450   	That unsubstantial death is amorous,
4451   	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
4452   	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
4453   	For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
4454   	And never from this palace of dim night
4455   	Depart again: here, here will I remain
4456   	With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
4457   	Will I set up my everlasting rest,
4458   	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
4459   	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
4460   	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
4461   	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
4462   	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
4463   	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
4464   	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
4465   	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
4466   	Here's to my love!
4467   
4468   	[Drinks]
4469   
4470   	O true apothecary!
4471   	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
4472   
4473   	[Dies]
4474   
4475   	[Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR
4476   	LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade]
4477   
4478   FRIAR LAURENCE	Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
4479   	Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
4480   
4481   BALTHASAR	Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
4482   
4483   FRIAR LAURENCE	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
4484   	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
4485   	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
4486   	It burneth in the Capel's monument.
4487   
4488   BALTHASAR	It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
4489   	One that you love.
4490   
4491   FRIAR LAURENCE	                  Who is it?
4492   
4493   BALTHASAR	Romeo.
4494   
4495   FRIAR LAURENCE	How long hath he been there?
4496   
4497   BALTHASAR	Full half an hour.
4498   
4499   FRIAR LAURENCE	Go with me to the vault.
4500   
4501   BALTHASAR	I dare not, sir
4502   	My master knows not but I am gone hence;
4503   	And fearfully did menace me with death,
4504   	If I did stay to look on his intents.
4505   
4506   FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
4507   	O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
4508   
4509   BALTHASAR	As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
4510   	I dreamt my master and another fought,
4511   	And that my master slew him.
4512   
4513   FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo!
4514   
4515   	[Advances]
4516   
4517   	Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
4518   	The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
4519   	What mean these masterless and gory swords
4520   	To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
4521   
4522   	[Enters the tomb]
4523   
4524   	Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
4525   	And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
4526   	Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
4527   	The lady stirs.
4528   
4529   	[JULIET wakes]
4530   
4531   JULIET	O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
4532   	I do remember well where I should be,
4533   	And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
4534   
4535   	[Noise within]
4536   
4537   FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
4538   	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
4539   	A greater power than we can contradict
4540   	Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
4541   	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
4542   	And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
4543   	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
4544   	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
4545   	Come, go, good Juliet,
4546   
4547   	[Noise again]
4548   
4549   		 I dare no longer stay.
4550   
4551   JULIET	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
4552   
4553   	[Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]
4554   
4555   	What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
4556   	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
4557   	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
4558   	To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
4559   	Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
4560   	To make die with a restorative.
4561   
4562   	[Kisses him]
4563   
4564   	Thy lips are warm.
4565   
4566   First Watchman	[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?
4567   
4568   JULIET	Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
4569   
4570   	[Snatching ROMEO's dagger]
4571   
4572   	This is thy sheath;
4573   
4574   	[Stabs herself]
4575   
4576   	there rust, and let me die.
4577   
4578   	[Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies]
4579   
4580   	[Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS]
4581   
4582   PAGE	This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
4583   
4584   First Watchman	The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
4585   	Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
4586   	Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
4587   	And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
4588   	Who here hath lain these two days buried.
4589   	Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
4590   	Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
4591   	We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
4592   	But the true ground of all these piteous woes
4593   	We cannot without circumstance descry.
4594   
4595   	[Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR]
4596   
4597   Second Watchman	Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
4598   
4599   First Watchman	Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
4600   
4601   	[Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE]
4602   
4603   Third Watchman	Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
4604   	We took this mattock and this spade from him,
4605   	As he was coming from this churchyard side.
4606   
4607   First Watchman	A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
4608   
4609   	[Enter the PRINCE and Attendants]
4610   
4611   PRINCE	What misadventure is so early up,
4612   	That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4613   
4614   	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others]
4615   
4616   CAPULET	What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4617   
4618   LADY CAPULET	The people in the street cry Romeo,
4619   	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4620   	With open outcry toward our monument.
4621   
4622   PRINCE	What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4623   
4624   First Watchman	Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4625   	And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4626   	Warm and new kill'd.
4627   
4628   PRINCE	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4629   
4630   First Watchman	Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4631   	With instruments upon them, fit to open
4632   	These dead men's tombs.
4633   
4634   CAPULET	O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4635   	This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4636   	Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4637   	And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4638   
4639   LADY CAPULET	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4640   	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4641   
4642   	[Enter MONTAGUE and others]
4643   
4644   PRINCE	Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4645   	To see thy son and heir more early down.
4646   
4647   MONTAGUE	Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4648   	Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4649   	What further woe conspires against mine age?
4650   
4651   PRINCE	Look, and thou shalt see.
4652   
4653   MONTAGUE	O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4654   	To press before thy father to a grave?
4655   
4656   PRINCE	Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4657   	Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4658   	And know their spring, their head, their
4659   	true descent;
4660   	And then will I be general of your woes,
4661   	And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4662   	And let mischance be slave to patience.
4663   	Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4664   
4665   FRIAR LAURENCE	I am the greatest, able to do least,
4666   	Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4667   	Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4668   	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4669   	Myself condemned and myself excused.
4670   
4671   PRINCE	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4672   
4673   FRIAR LAURENCE	I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4674   	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4675   	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4676   	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4677   	I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4678   	Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4679   	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4680   	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4681   	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4682   	Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4683   	To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4684   	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4685   	To rid her from this second marriage,
4686   	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4687   	Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4688   	A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4689   	As I intended, for it wrought on her
4690   	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4691   	That he should hither come as this dire night,
4692   	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4693   	Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4694   	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4695   	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4696   	Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4697   	At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4698   	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4699   	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4700   	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4701   	But when I came, some minute ere the time
4702   	Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4703   	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4704   	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4705   	And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4706   	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4707   	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4708   	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4709   	All this I know; and to the marriage
4710   	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4711   	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4712   	Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4713   	Unto the rigour of severest law.
4714   
4715   PRINCE	We still have known thee for a holy man.
4716   	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4717   
4718   BALTHASAR	I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4719   	And then in post he came from Mantua
4720   	To this same place, to this same monument.
4721   	This letter he early bid me give his father,
4722   	And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4723   	I departed not and left him there.
4724   
4725   PRINCE	Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4726   	Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4727   	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4728   
4729   PAGE	He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4730   	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4731   	Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4732   	And by and by my master drew on him;
4733   	And then I ran away to call the watch.
4734   
4735   PRINCE	This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4736   	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4737   	And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4738   	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4739   	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4740   	Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4741   	See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4742   	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4743   	And I for winking at your discords too
4744   	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4745   
4746   CAPULET	O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4747   	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4748   	Can I demand.
4749   
4750   MONTAGUE   But I can give thee more:
4751   	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4752   	That while Verona by that name is known,
4753   	There shall no figure at such rate be set
4754   	As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4755   
4756   CAPULET	As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4757   	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4758   
4759   PRINCE	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4760   	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4761   	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4762   	Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4763   	For never was a story of more woe
4764   	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
4765   
4766   	[Exeunt]
